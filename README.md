# Workspace projects 2013

One of these sundays, during a global pandemic, not much to do, why not clean up some of my old files on the cloud.
I have noticed an entire soure code workspace (back when eclipse was still a thing for Android development!), with projects I have been working on.

Some are pet projects, others I have actually put lots of effort upon, some even were successfully published and distributed. Maybe you have downloaded them back in the day?
It is going to be a challenge to build these APKs nowadays, in a world where Gradle and Android Studio were far from the mind of any Android engineer.

Now it is all open source. The code quality isn't high, and most likely all networking related functionality is broken.

**I don't intend to maintain this code, nor access contributions. It is here solely as a back-up.**
